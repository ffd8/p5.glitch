    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repositoryâ€™s code at the default branch
      # This makes your code available for subsequent steps like installing dependencies and running tests.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ref: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}

      # Step 2: Set up a Node.js environment (Node 20.x) and configure npm to use the official registry
      # This ensures we have the right Node.js version and a proper registry URL for installs and publishing.
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies using npm ci
      # This ensures a clean, reproducible installation based on package-lock.json.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run your test suite (using the "test" script from package.json)
      # If tests fail, the workflow will stop here and not publish a broken version.
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # Step 5: Update package.json to match the release tag
      # The release tag (e.g., v1.0.1) is extracted, and npm version sets package.json version accordingly.
      # The --no-git-tag-version flag ensures npm doesn't create its own tags.
      # This step keeps package.json's version aligned with the release tag you just created.
      - name: Update package.json with release tag
        run: |
          TAG="${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}"
          echo "Updating package.json version to $TAG"
          npm version "$TAG" --no-git-tag-version
          
      # Step 6: Commit and push the updated package.json and package-lock.json back to the repo
      # This ensures your repository always reflects the exact version published.
      # We use the GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate and the granted write permissions to push changes.
      - name: Commit and push version update
        run: |
          TAG="${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}"

      # Step 7: Publish the new version to npm
      # The NODE_AUTH_TOKEN is your npm access token stored as a secret.
      # npm publish --access public makes the package available to anyone on npm.
